<h1>FAQ - PARTICLE PHYSICS LOVERS</h1>
<h2>Millions of questions, but here are some of them we actually have
answers to...</h2>
    <p id="para">For every question, for every problem we solve in the area that is particle physics, it seems we find a
hundred more. Every once in a while, a breakthrough happens,<a href="#para">Max Planck and quantum theory</a> - but most
of the time we only get more questions.. and answers with a shelf life of a year or two until someone always
seems to disprove them.</p>
    <p>But some things can actually be answered with a degree of certainty, and here's some of them that we seem
to get asked again and again.</P>

  <h3>What did Albert Einstein call "spooky action at a distance"?</h3>
  <em name>John Doe - Minnesota, USA</em name>
     <p>That would be quantum entanglement. Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when
pairs or groups of particles are generated or interact in ways such that the quantum state of each particle
cannot be described independentlyâ€”instead, a quantum state may be given for the system as a whole.</p>

     <h3>Why do particle physicists have to smash protons or other subatomic particles to do
their work?</h3>
<em name>John Doe-Minnesota,USA</em name>
       <h4>The act of colliding subatomic particles at very high energy is not merely a destructive act; it is, more
profoundly, a creative one.</h4>
      <p>It is a remarkable property of nature that when sufficient energy is crammed into a sufficiently small space,
particles that were not previously present can sometimes be created out of that energy. This is, in fact, why
we do high-energy particle collisions. The extremely-compressed-energy technique is the only one we know
that can allow us to create heavy or exceedingly rare particles that humans have never previously observed.
We have no other way to make Higgs particles, for instance.</p>

  <h3>Oh yeah, and what the heck is a particle accelerator by the way?</h3>
  <em name>John Doe - Minnesota, USA</em name>
      <p>A particle accelerator is a device that uses electromagnetic fields to propel charged particles to high speeds
and to contain them in well-defined beams. Large accelerators are best known for their use in particle
physics as colliders (e.g. the LHC at CERN, RHIC at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and Tevatron at
Fermilab). Other kinds of particle accelerators are used in a large variety of applications, including particle
therapy for oncological purposes, and as synchrotron light sources for the study of condensed matter
physics. There are currently more than 30,000 accelerators in operation around the world.</p><br/>

<h3>What in the name of all that is holy is Quantum Theory?</h3>
<em name>John Doe - Minnesota, USA</em name>
<p>Quantum theory is the theoretical basis of modern physics that explains the nature and behavior of matter
and energy on the atomic and subatomic level. The nature and behavior of matter and energy at that level is
sometimes referred to as quantum physics and quantum mechanics.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between general and special relativity?</h3>
<em name>John Doe - Minnesota, USA</em name>
<ol>
<li 1> Special relativity (SR) doesn't include gravity, whereas general relativity (GR) does.
<li 1>In SR, the laws of physics are the same for all inertial coordinate systems, that is those in which Newton's
First Law of Motion is true. In GR the laws of physics are the same in all coordinate systems, whether they
are inertial or not. So SR is a special case of GR.
